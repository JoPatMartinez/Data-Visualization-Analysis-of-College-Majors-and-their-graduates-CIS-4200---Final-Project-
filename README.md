# Data-Visualization-of-College-Majors-and-their-salaries-CIS-4200---Final-Project-

What is the difference in pay for graduates in different majors?

**The main objective/goal of this project was to:**

- Analyze the difference in salaries by college type, college region, and also analyze the difference in salary increase by each major
- Figure out which college and/or college major will lead to high-paying careers, as well as which ones will lead to low paying careers
- To see how impactful the region a college is located is to high-demand and salary for college graduates
- Assist college students/upcoming college students that may want to know which majors lead to high paying careers. and which colleges provide that

**From this dataset, we try to analyze and solve the following questions:**

1. What are the highest and lowest paying majors by annual salary?
2. Do graduates from highly prestigious universities (Engineering or Ivy League) actually have higher paying jobs/are able to obtain raises more than those who attended other schools
3. If those who attended universities on the east and west coast tend to have higher-paying jobs?
4. Are there majors that typically pay a lower entry-level job and then pay better after years of experience?
